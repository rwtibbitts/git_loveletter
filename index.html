        <p>Dear Git,</p>
        <br>
        <p>You’re like a gateway drug to me. So simple and sleek, but a passage to something much greater. </p>
        <br>
        <p>You had me at git init, when you stashed a hidden folder deep inside my heart. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I can always be sure that you’ll tell me exactly how it is when I run git status, and if anything in our relationship has changed, you let me git add ___ or git add ..</p>
        <br>
        <p>My favorite part of you, though I don’t know why, is your staging area. I can see everything that we’ve done together, and decide if I want to git commit with a cute –m “message” to remember it later.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love that you keep a diary of everything we do, and you let me read it when I ask git log.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when we decide we’re ready for the next step, we’ll get married by your friend, Github. I’ll say my vows, git remote add origin _____, and you’ll say yours. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I’ll spare the details, but you can be sure there’s some git push –u origin master in store for us later. </p>
        <br>
